"""Restore video with the LTX model in four passes, one model on the GPU at a time.

1. scan: decode, detect mosaics and scene cuts, plan tracks, cameras and windows;
2. encode: crop every window's 121 frames onto its canvas and VAE-encode them;
3. denoise: run each track's windows through the transformer in lockstep;
4. compose: decode each window's latent when the video reaches it, composite, write.

The unit of work is a segment: the frames of one pts range, planned on their own with
frame indices from the segment's first frame, so a segment restores the same way whatever
surrounds it. A whole video is one segment. Spans are the decoded stretches holding the
segments; every pass decodes each span again (the camera and fusion need a whole track
before its first window can be denoised). Per-window latents (1-2 MB) are kept in a
disk directory between passes, so memory does not grow with length. Offline jobs keep
that directory to resume; previews and speed tests use temporary directories.
