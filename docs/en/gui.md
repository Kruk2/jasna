# Using the GUI

Every setting has a tooltip. Move the mouse over the ⓘ icon next to it.

The first start after an install or update takes longer. A loading window shows
the installation check before the main window opens. If the check fails, the
error stays on screen.

Install Jasna on a local disk (NTFS on Windows; ext4, Btrfs or XFS on Linux),
in a folder whose path has no Chinese, Japanese, accented or other
non-English characters. Network disks
are not supported.

## The queue

- Add videos or images with **Add files**, or with the folder icon next to it
  for a whole folder. You can also drag and drop files onto the queue.
- Drag an item by its handle to change the order. Jasna processes the queue
  from top to bottom.
- With more than 20 items, use the arrows below the queue to change the page.
  All pages are processed in order. Dragging works only inside one page.
- Buttons on each video:
  - **Scissors** opens the [Segment Editor](segments.md).
  - **Play** opens the video in the Video Player, paused.
  - **Three dots** (or right-click): **Open containing folder**, **Copy path**,
    **Open restored output**, and **Requeue**, which puts a finished, failed or
    skipped item back at the end of the queue.
  - **Cross** removes the item.
- During processing, each item shows progress, FPS and time left.
- **▶** (start) always processes everything in the queue, including items
  that are already finished or failed. So you can change settings and press ▶
  again without adding the files again.
- **■** (stop) ends the run. The current item goes back to **Pending**. The half-written
  output file stays on disk; **File Conflict** decides what happens with it
  next time.
- **Clear done** removes finished items. **Clear** removes everything.

## Output settings

- **Same as input** saves each result next to its original file.
- Type a folder path or use the folder button to save somewhere else. This
  turns off **Same as input**. Click **Same as input** to turn it back on.
- **Output pattern** sets the output name. `{original}` is the input file
  name. If a name would overwrite another file, the queue items are marked at
  once.
- **File Conflict** (in **Basic Processing**) decides what to do when the
  output file already exists: **Auto-Rename** (default), **Overwrite** or
  **Skip**.

## Presets

The bar at the top of the settings saves all settings under one name. Make one
preset for each type of video, for example "1080p fast" and "4K best quality",
and switch with one click. Jasna remembers the last preset after a restart.

## Per-video settings

The detection model and detection threshold you set in the [Segment Editor](segments.md)
are saved for that one video. Other videos in the queue keep their own.

## Video Player

Click **Video Player** in the header to watch a video while Jasna restores it.
No output file is created.

1. Choose the detection model, detection threshold and, if you want, a
   secondary restoration (**RTX Super Res** or **UNet 4x**).
2. Click **Choose video**.
3. Press play.

- **Space**: play or pause. **Left/Right**: jump 30 seconds.
- In full screen, move the mouse to the bottom edge to show the controls.
- If you change the model, detection threshold or secondary restoration, playback
  restarts from the same position.
- The status shows how many seconds are restored ahead. If it drops to zero
  again and again, your GPU is too slow for real time with these settings.
  Audio waits until more frames are ready.
- The player always uses BasicVSR++, not LTX.
- It works only when the queue and the **Restore preview** are not running.

## Images, one by one

For still images, **Process images interactively** (in the **Image Restoration (still images)** section)
opens a side-by-side view. Go through your images, try other seeds, compare
original, mask and result, and save only the results you like. This is much
faster than running the whole job again for each try.

## System check

On the first start of each version, Jasna checks FFprobe, the GPU, the driver
and the install path. You can run it again from the header, for example after a driver
update.

## Other settings

- **Language**: the first start uses your system language. Change it in the
  header. Restart Jasna to change all texts.
- **Logs**: the Logs button in the bottom bar shows live logs. **Export** saves
  the last 5000 lines. Please attach it when you report a problem.
- **System stats**: the bottom bar shows GPU, VRAM, RAM and CPU use during
  processing.

## Activate supporter models

Supporter models (UNet 4x, SD 1.5, LTX) need activation. Open **Activate Jasna** in
the header.

- **Online** (default): enter your **License code** and click
  **Activate online**.
- **Manual**, for a PC without internet or when online fails:
  1. Copy the **Machine key**.
  2. On any device with internet, open the
     [activation page](https://jasna-activation.kruk2.workers.dev) (or click
     **Open activation page**) and enter the Machine key and your License code.
     You can also send both to where you got your License code.
  3. Paste the **Activation key** you get back into Jasna and click
     **Activate**.

Good to know:

- One License code works on **3 PCs or cloud workspaces**. Activating the same
  PC again does not use a new slot. Only the owner can free a slot.
- An Activation key covers only the models you bought.
- **Activate online** sends only your License code and Machine key. After
  that, Jasna works offline.
- Key rejected? Check the Machine key and copy the whole Activation key again.
  Keys made for older Jasna versions need a new key from where you got your License code.

License codes come only from
[Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/kruk2),
[Unifans](https://app.unifans.io/c/kruk2) and, for China, the Xianyu seller in the
[Chinese README](../../README.zh.md#在闲鱼购买). Support tiers: see
[Supporting the project](../../README.md#supporting-the-project).
On the first launch of each version, Jasna runs a system check (GPU, driver,
memory, install path). You can re-run it any time from the header — useful
after a driver update or when something misbehaves.

## Other bits worth knowing

- **Language**: the first start follows your system language. Switch it any
  time from the header dropdown (restart for the full effect).
- **Logs**: the Logs button in the bottom bar shows live logs with level
  filters and an export button (the newest 5000 entries) — attach an export when
  reporting a problem.
- **System stats**: GPU, VRAM, RAM, and CPU usage are shown in the bottom
  bar while processing.
- **License**: enter your supporter key from the header; the chip shows
  whether it's active.
  Keys are sold only on Buy Me a Coffee and Unifans (kruk2); keys from other
  sellers are fake and do not work.
  If verification fails, check the exact purchase email or handle and paste the complete
  key again. Known unofficial keys get a separate warning.
  Updating Jasna does not change which models your key includes.
