"""Reaching lightweight restorer helpers must not drag in the torch stack.

The GUI builds its Image Restoration section on startup and calls
``sd15_download.bundle_present`` (a pure filesystem check). If importing that helper
also imported ``jasna.restorer``'s torch-backed restorers, the window would block for
several seconds on every launch. These tests pin the import to stay light.
